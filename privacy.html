    <h2>1. About this website</h2>
    <p>
        This website (<strong>chapter322.github.io/FreeTapWater</strong>) is a personal, non-commercial project 
        operated by <strong>Chapter322</strong> (GitHub username) to collect and display publicly shared information 
        about restaurants and cafes that offer free or reasonably priced tap water.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        The purpose of this website is to inform visitors and allow them to share relevant public information 
        about hospitality venues’ tap water policies. This is done purely for informational and non-commercial purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Personal data</h2>
    <p>
        This website does not intentionally collect personal data from visitors. However:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The displayed restaurant data (name, location, address) may, in some cases, 
            identify a natural person — for example, in the case of sole proprietorships or personally owned cafes.
        </li>
        <li>
            This data is publicly available and generally already shared by the establishments themselves, 
            but under the GDPR it can still be considered personal data.
        </li>
        <li>
            In such cases, the website acts as both the data <em>controller</em> and <em>processor</em> of the 
            published information.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data sources</h2>
    <p>
        The information about restaurants is collected from public submissions, online resources, 
        and publicly available information (e.g., Google Maps, OpenStreetMap).
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-party services</h2>
    <p>
        This website uses:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>GitHub Pages</strong> for hosting. GitHub may log IP addresses and request data for security and analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>OpenStreetMap</strong> embedded via an <code>iframe</code> to display locations. OpenStreetMap servers may log IP addresses.</li>
        <li><strong>Google Fonts</strong> for typography. Fonts are served by Google, which may log requests and associated IPs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Your rights</h2>
    <p>
        If you are a data subject under GDPR and believe that the website is displaying personal data about you, 
        you can request correction or removal by contacting <strong>Chapter322</strong> via 
        <a href="https://github.com/Chapter322" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
        This is a personal project with no commercial intent. While the information is collected and maintained with care, 
        no guarantee is given as to its accuracy or completeness.
