    <h2>1. About this website</h2>
    <p>
        This website (<strong>chapter322.github.io/FreeTapWater</strong>) is a personal, non-commercial project 
        owned and operated by <strong>Chapter322</strong> (GitHub username).  
        Its purpose is to collect and display publicly available information 
        about restaurants and cafes that offer free or reasonably priced tap water.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Purpose</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of this website is to help visitors make informed choices about hospitality venues’ tap water policies.  
        It exists purely for informational and non-commercial purposes.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Personal data</h2>
    <p>
        This website does not intentionally collect personal data from visitors. However:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The displayed restaurant data (name, location, address) may, in some cases, 
            identify a natural person — for example, in the case of sole proprietorships or personally owned cafes.
        </li>
        <li>
            This data is publicly available and generally already shared by the establishments themselves, 
            but under the GDPR it can still be considered personal data.
        </li>
        <li>
            In such cases, the website acts as both the data <em>controller</em> and <em>processor</em> of the 
            published information.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data sources</h2>
    <p>
        The information about restaurants is collected from public submissions, online resources, 
        and publicly available data (e.g., Google Maps, OpenStreetMap, or the venues’ own websites).
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third-party services</h2>
    <p>
        This website uses:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>GitHub Pages</strong> for hosting. GitHub may log IP addresses and request data for security and analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>OpenStreetMap</strong> embedded via an <code>iframe</code> to display locations. OpenStreetMap servers may log IP addresses.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Your rights</h2>
    <p>
        If you are a data subject under GDPR and believe that the website is displaying personal data about you, 
        you can request correction or removal by contacting <strong>Chapter322</strong> at 
        <a href="mailto:contact.danatec@gmail.com">contact.danatec@gmail.com</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
        This is a personal project with no commercial intent. While the information is collected and maintained with care, 
        no guarantee is given as to its accuracy or completeness.
